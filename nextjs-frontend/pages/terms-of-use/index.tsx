          <p>NOOBSTORM WALLET</p>
          <p>
            Noobstorm Gaming Private Limited&nbsp;may make available an account
            balance associated with your Account (the &quot;Noobstorm
            Wallet&quot;). The Noobstorm Wallet is neither a bank account nor
            any kind of payment instrument. It functions as a prepaid balance to
            order Content, Services and/or join tournaments. You may place funds
            in your Noobstorm Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by the
            Company from time to time, by credit card, prepaid card, promotional
            code, or any other payment method accepted by Noobstorm. The Company
            may change or impose different Wallet balance and usage limits from
            time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be notified by e-mail of any change to the Wallet balance
            and usage limits within sixty (60) calendar days before the entry
            into force of the change. Your continued use of your &nbsp;Noobstorm
            Account more than thirty (30) calendar days after the entry into
            force of the changes will constitute your acceptance of the changes.
            If you don&rsquo;t agree to the changes, your only remedy is to
            terminate your Noobstorm Account or to cease use of your Noobstorm
            Wallet. Noobstorm shall not have any obligation to refund any
            credits remaining on your Noobstorm Wallet in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funds added to the Noobstorm Wallet are non-refundable and
            non-transferable. Wallet funds do not constitute a personal property
            right, have no value outside &nbsp;and can only be used to
            participate in tournaments hosted on the platform. Wallet funds have
            no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash. Wallet funds that
            are deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the applicable
            authority.

          <p>TOURNAMENT ORGANIZERS, PRIZES AND REWARDS&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            We organize and help organizers create and manage competitions for
            online video game tournaments and help gamers find tournaments to
            join. Each tournament is different because it is subject to the
            parameters set by us, including, without limitation, interactions
            and rankings among event attendees, communications and the awarding
            of prizes, if any. By using the Services, you agree to these
            additional parameters and agree to receive communications from the
            organizer or Us subject to applicable laws. Further, any
            communications from organizers, including, without limitation, any
            representations, content or links supplied or promises of prizes or
            rewards, are made solely by the organizers. Noobstorm is not
            responsible for monitoring organizers&rsquo; communications or
            administering any prizes or rewards. Even if we provide any
            assistance in the administering of prizes or rewards, the tournament
            organizer still remains responsible for the determination of
            eligibility and the distribution of any prizes or rewards. If any
            representations, content or links supplied or promises of prizes or
            rewards, are made by Us we shall determine the eligibility,
            administer and distribute the prizes or rewards directly to your
            Noobstorm account.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Noobstorm cannot guarantee that any tournament organizer who hosts
            an event through the Services will distribute advertised or promised
            prizes or rewards. You participate in the Services at your own risk
            and agree that Noobstorm is not responsible for any tournament
            prizes offered by tournament organizers.

                Waiver: The failure at any time to require performance of any
                provision of these Terms of Use shall in no manner affect our

                any breach of these Terms of Use, whether by conduct or
                otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be
