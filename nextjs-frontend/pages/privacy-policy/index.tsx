          <p>Personal data</p>
          <p>
            Personal data, or personal information means any information that
            relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. This is
            a broad definition which includes the specific pieces of personal
            data which we have described below. It does not include data which
            cannot be used to identify an individual person, such as a company
            registration number.
          </p>
          <p>
            A &ldquo;data subject&rdquo; is an individual who can be identified,
            directly or indirectly, by personal data. This is usually by
            reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number,
            location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
            specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
            cultural or social identity of that natural person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead
            to the identification of a particular person, also constitute
            personal data. It does not include data where the identity has been
            removed.

                request access to your personal data, which enables you to
                obtain confirmation of whether we are processing your personal
                data, to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you
                and information regarding how your personal data is being used
                by us;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                request rectification of your personal data by asking us to
                rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete
                information you think is incomplete, though we may need to
                verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                request erasure of your personal data by asking us to delete or
                remove personal data we hold about you; note, however, that we
                may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
                for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                object to the processing of your personal data, where we are
                relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
                there is something about your particular situation which makes
                you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
                impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; in some cases,
                we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                process your information which override your rights and
                freedoms; you also have the right to object where we are
                processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely
                by automated means, without human involvement; you will be
                notified if decisions are made solely on an automated basis;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                request restriction of processing your personal data, which
                enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
                data, if you want us to establish the data accuracy; where our
                use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;
                where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require
                it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims,
                or if you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to
                verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
                party, and we will provide to you, or a third party you have
                chosen (where technically feasible), your personal data in a
                structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; note that
                this right only applies to automated information which you
                initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
                information to perform a contract with you;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
                process your personal data; however, this will not affect the
                lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
                your consent; if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able
                to provide certain products or services to you, but we will
                advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your
                consent;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                complain to the DPC or any relevant authority about any
                perceived violation and to seek compensation for damages in the
                courts.

          <p>No fee usually required</p>
          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
            Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these
            circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>Period for replying to a legitimate request</p>
          <p>
            The statutory period for us to reply to a legitimate request is one
            month. That period may be extended by two further months where
            necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that we may request that you provide some details
            necessary to verify your identity when you request to exercise a
            legal right regarding your personal data.
